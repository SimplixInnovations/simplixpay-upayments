## Overview

**SUPCheckout for UPayments** connects WooCommerce checkout to UPayments while preserving WooCommerce order semantics, authenticated provider verification and merchant-data compatibility.

SUPCheckout is intentionally **UPayments-specific**. Other payment providers belong in separate products/repositories; this codebase is not a generic payment-orchestration platform.

### What is covered

| Capability | Repository status |
|---|---|
| WooCommerce Classic checkout | Verified |
| Cart / Checkout Blocks registration and availability | Verified |
| HPOS and legacy order storage | Verified in the certified matrix |
| Authenticated provider-status verification | Verified |
| Saved-card/token provenance boundaries | Verified |
| Subscription eligibility and pre-dispatch safeguards | Verified |
| One additional-merchant allocation | Verified boundary |
| Deterministic ZIP, checksum and manifest | Permanent release gate |
| Historical package-root migration/rollback | Permanent release gate |
| Official WordPress Plugin Check on the packaged artifact | Strict gate |
| Automatic WooCommerce refunds | Not supported |
| Arbitrary marketplace multi-split | Not supported |
| Live subscription auto-deduction | External/manual qualification required |

Payment-method and wallet availability still depends on the merchant's UPayments account, provider configuration, plugin settings and device/account eligibility.

## Compatibility

The current certified matrix covers exact WordPress, WooCommerce, PHP and order-storage combinations rather than broad untested ranges.

| Platform | Certified scope |
|---|---|
| WordPress | 6.9.x, 7.0.x and 7.1 cells |
| WooCommerce | 10.8.x, 11.0.x and 11.1.x cells |
| PHP | 7.4, 8.3 and 8.4 cells |
| Order storage | Legacy + HPOS |
| Checkout | Classic + Cart / Checkout Blocks registration/availability |

See [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for the exact evidence boundary and unsupported/external-manual cases.

## Release status

The repository is on development line **0.1.0**. A public Git tag, GitHub Release and WordPress.org publication have **not** been created yet.

`main` is protected by required Quality, H12 Regression, Compatibility and Release gates. The release pipeline builds a deterministic package from Git `HEAD`, verifies its source bytes, exercises packaged WordPress/WooCommerce installs and runs the official WordPress Plugin Check against the unpacked artifact.

Current engineering evidence belongs in [`docs/project/PROJECT-STATUS.md`](docs/project/PROJECT-STATUS.md); retained milestone evidence belongs in [`docs/project/ENTERPRISE-CERTIFICATION.md`](docs/project/ENTERPRISE-CERTIFICATION.md).

## Technical identity

| Surface | Canonical identity |
|---|---|
| Product | **SUPCheckout for UPayments** |
| Short name | **SUPCheckout** |
| Repository / package slug | `supcheckout` |
| WordPress text domain | `supcheckout` |
| PHP namespace | `Simplixi\SUPCheckout` |
| Package root | `supcheckout/` |
| First-stable bootstrap | `supcheckout/UPayments.php` |

The physical `UPayments.php` bootstrap is intentional. Real upgrade qualification showed that renaming an already-active plugin main file can strand WordPress's stored plugin basename. A future physical rename requires its own migration contract and evidence.

Some UPayments-facing/persisted identities are also intentionally retained for merchant compatibility, including the gateway ID `upayments`, `woocommerce_upayments_settings`, callback identity `wc_upayments`, historical `_upay_*` metadata and related token/subscription state. See [`docs/project/NAMING-IDENTITY-STANDARD.md`](docs/project/NAMING-IDENTITY-STANDARD.md).

## Build the development package

The production plugin has no runtime Composer dependency. Composer is development tooling only.

```bash
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
composer validate --strict
composer audit --locked
composer quality

rm -rf dist
bash scripts/build-release.sh dist
bash scripts/verify-release.sh dist/supcheckout-0.1.0.zip
sha256sum dist/supcheckout-0.1.0.zip
cat dist/supcheckout-0.1.0.zip.sha256
```

The artifact contract provides:

- one `supcheckout/` ZIP root;
- exact distributable bytes sourced from Git `HEAD`;
- deterministic ordering, timestamps and modes;
- ZIP SHA-256 sidecar;
- sorted per-file SHA-256 manifest;
- source-byte verification and tamper rejection;
- packaged legacy/HPOS activation and order-storage smoke;
- historical package-root migration/rollback qualification.

## Security and payment integrity

SUPCheckout treats browser redirects and callback/webhook bodies as signals, not financial truth by themselves.

- Paid state requires authenticated provider verification and exact order/transaction/economic binding.
- Non-idempotent payment operations are not blindly retried.
- Checkout does not rely on third-party font/icon CDNs.
- Merchant secrets, card data and token/provenance secrets must not appear in diagnostics, browser output or CI logs.
- Uninstall is non-destructive by default.

Historical records intentionally preserve former product names, repository coordinates and milestone SHAs when those were true at the time.

## Support
