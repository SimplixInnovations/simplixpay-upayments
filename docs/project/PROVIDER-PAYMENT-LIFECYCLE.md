## Closure decision

Provider Contract & Payment Lifecycle is **DONE / VERIFIED** for the ordinary WooCommerce checkout lifecycle scope defined below.

The gate is closed because the provider/WooCommerce contract was researched against current official documentation, frozen before runtime implementation, implemented behind an isolated `Simplix\Pay\UPayments\Payment` strangler, independently challenged by automated review, fully regression-tested on the exact PR merge-ref, squash-merged, post-merge verified on `main`, and cleaned up.

This closure certifies the reviewed local lifecycle contract. It does **not** certify automatic refunds, arbitrary multi-merchant marketplace splitting, provider webhook HMAC verification that UPayments has not fully documented, subscription auto-deduction redesign, broad security closure, or broad WooCommerce/WordPress/PHP/WPML/performance compatibility.

The program gate immediately after this closure was **Security Threat-Model Closure**; that bounded gate, Architecture discovery/A1-A5 and Quality Platform Q1-Q9 are now **DONE / VERIFIED**. The current program gate is **Full Automated Quality Platform — Q10**.

## Scope

This gate covers the ordinary checkout payment lifecycle:

- existing Charge request/response behavior already characterized by H12;
- browser return and server-to-server notification handling;
- authenticated Get Payment Status reconciliation;
- deterministic provider-result classification;
- WooCommerce paid/failed/cancelled transitions;
- replay/idempotency and bounded reconciliation;
- status-query rate limiting;
- current refund and multi-merchant capability boundaries.

Historical token migration remains governed by the closed H12/Phase 9I contracts. Subscription auto-deduction retains its separately characterized scheduler/attempt-journal path and was not silently rewritten by this tranche.

Live source base characterized:

- `UPayments.php` blob `0f9ee544afcd846e01ff0bee4072175b93e49c60`;
- historical callback route `wc_upayments`;
- inherited Bearer-authenticated `get-payment-status/{track_id}` behavior;
- existing Phase 0, Phase 9I, H12 PHP and H12 Blocks regression suites.

## Frozen provider/lifecycle contract

### Charge

- POST `/api/v1/charge` with Bearer authentication.
- `notificationUrl` is mandatory.
- Charge success requires HTTP `201`, boolean `status === true`, structurally valid response data and a valid external redirect URL under the existing H12 contract.
- Successful Charge initialization is **not** proof that funds were captured.
- An indeterminate Charge is never blindly retried by lifecycle reconciliation because no provider idempotency contract for Charge is assumed.

### Callback/webhook authority

UPayments callback/browser fields are routing and diagnostic input only. They never authorize a financial state transition.

The new lifecycle controller:

- preserves the historical `wc_upayments` route;
- runs at priority 5 before the inherited priority-10 handler;
- leaves the inherited `get_order_status` display poll untouched;
- merges GET/POST callback values explicitly and rejects conflicting values;
- excludes cookies and never uses `$_REQUEST`;
- locally preflights Woo order ID and `UPayments_order_id` before provider lookup.

### Authoritative payment truth

Financial truth is established only through this chain:

1. Bearer-authenticated Get Payment Status response;
2. exact HTTPS UPayments status-host/path allowlist;
3. HTTP `201` and strict top-level success/schema validation;
4. strict transaction binding to the WooCommerce order;
5. deterministic provider-result classification;
6. concurrency-locked WooCommerce state transition.

Browser return parameters, webhook fields, provider result text and callback `payment_id` never authorize paid state by themselves.

### Exact transaction binding

Every authenticated status response used to mutate an order must bind all of:

- `track_id` exactly to the current reconciliation cursor;
- `merchant_requested_order_id` exactly to local `UPayments_order_id`;
- `reference` exactly to the WooCommerce order ID;
- `currency_type` exactly to the order currency after the existing UPayments currency mapping;
- `total_price` exactly to the local order total using canonical decimal-string equality;
- for `CAPTURED`, a non-empty provider `payment_id`.

Amount comparison does **not** round through WooCommerce display precision. Canonical decimal values may differ only by insignificant trailing fractional zeros. For example, `10.00` equals `10.0000`; `10.004` does not equal `10.00`.

### Provider-result classification

Only exact provider values receive state-changing meaning:

| Provider result | Local class | Woo behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `CAPTURED` | `CAPTURED` | canonical Woo payment completion |
| `PENDING` | `PENDING` | remain unpaid; reconcile |
| `AUTHORIZED` | `PENDING` | remain unpaid; reconcile |
| `APPROVED` | `PENDING` | remain unpaid; reconcile |
| `NOT CAPTURED` | `FAILED` | fail only an unverified/unpaid order |
| `FAILED` | `FAILED` | fail only an unverified/unpaid order |
| `ERROR` | `FAILED` | fail only an unverified/unpaid order |
| `CANCELED` | `CANCELLED` | cancel only an unverified/unpaid order |
| `NULL` provider result | `INDETERMINATE` | remain unpaid; reconcile |
| `Processing` / unknown future value | `INDETERMINATE` | remain unpaid; reconcile |
| `REFUND` / `VOIDED` for unverified initial payment | `INDETERMINATE` | never infer initial capture |

Unknown future values fail closed. Provider documentation indicating pending/processing/NULL-style outcomes are non-terminal is preserved rather than guessed into failure.

### Canonical WooCommerce payment completion

Authenticated/bound `CAPTURED` uses:

`$order->payment_complete($verified_payment_id)`

The lifecycle no longer treats direct paid-state `update_status()` as the canonical success path.

This preserves WooCommerce's standard transaction ID, paid lifecycle and `woocommerce_payment_complete` behavior. The existing merchant “Show paid orders as Completed?” setting is applied through WooCommerce's payment-complete status filter for the exact order rather than bypassing Woo payment completion.

The `_upay_verified_capture` flag is written only after paid state and transaction-ID postconditions are verified. Duplicate/replayed callbacks after verified capture make zero additional provider calls and do not re-fire payment completion.

A pre-existing paid order is never downgraded by a later terminal provider response. A refunded order is never resurrected.

## Reconciliation contract

### Two cursor trust levels

The implementation distinguishes:

- an **unverified routing cursor**, stored only after local callback/order preflight so an initial transient provider lookup can be retried;
- a **trusted cursor**, promoted only after an authenticated status response is fully rebound to the fresh Woo order.

Both cursor states are paired with the current provider Charge identity (`UPayments_order_id`). If the same Woo order begins a later UPayments Charge attempt, stale cursor/reconciliation state from the prior attempt cannot pin or contaminate the new attempt.

### Bounded retries

For authenticated unresolved states or retryable status-query failures with a safe current-attempt cursor:

- one deduplicated single-event reconciliation is scheduled;
- delays are `60, 120, 240, 480` seconds;
- maximum four scheduled attempts;
- every attempt repeats authenticated status verification and full order binding;
- no lifecycle reconciliation path creates or retries a Charge;
- terminal capture/failure/cancellation, refund state, verified capture, binding/cursor conflict or exhaustion stops scheduling;
- exhaustion leaves the order unpaid and creates one sanitized merchant note requiring manual review.

A binding mismatch clears the unverified cursor and does not schedule blind retries.

## Concurrency contract

A database-backed per-order lock prevents browser return, webhook and reconciliation workers from concurrently driving the same Woo lifecycle.

Stale-lock takeover uses compare-and-swap semantics against the exact stored lock value; it never blindly deletes a contested option. Release likewise conditionally deletes only the current owner's exact scalar lock record. The regression harness simulates a competing worker replacing a stale record and proves the newer owner's lock is not deleted.

## Status-query transport/rate contract

The verifier:

- accepts only HTTPS UPayments status endpoints under the exact allowed hosts/path;
- rejects query-bearing/foreign endpoints before sending credentials;
- disables redirects;
- keeps TLS verification enabled;
- uses a finite 15-second timeout;
- consumes rate-limit capacity only after URL validation.

UPayments documentation reviewed for this gate is contradictory:

- dedicated Get Payment Status page: **30 requests/minute**;
- FAQ: status/refund endpoints **800 requests/minute**.

The plugin deliberately uses the stricter **30 requests/minute** credential/mode-scoped atomic rate gate until UPayments resolves the contradiction.

## Webhook signature/HMAC unresolved boundary

UPayments states that server-to-server webhooks are signed / HMAC support is being rolled out, but the public documentation reviewed on 2026-08-25 did not provide a complete stable verification contract covering header name, canonical payload, algorithm/key derivation and rotation.

Therefore:

- no signature verifier was fabricated;
- callback payload fields remain non-authoritative;
- every financial transition still requires authenticated status lookup and strict binding;
- exact webhook HMAC verification remains **PROVIDER-DOC-UNRESOLVED** and becomes explicit input to Security Threat-Model Closure.

## Refund boundary

Automatic WooCommerce gateway refunds remain intentionally **UNSUPPORTED** and are not advertised.

UPayments documents asynchronous full/multiple-partial refunds, status polling, no refund webhook and no current idempotency-key support. Adding `process_refund()` without a durable local refund-intent/idempotency/reconciliation journal would create duplicate-refund risk. Refund automation remains a later dedicated certification tranche.

## Multi-merchant boundary

UPayments can accept a multi-entry `extraMerchantData` allocation array. Current SimplixPay behavior remains exactly one additional merchant allocation whose amount equals the order amount.

Frozen current support claim:

> **Single additional merchant allocation only. Arbitrary multi-split marketplace routing is not certified.**

Expansion requires a separate routing/allocation/refund characterization.

## Implementation shape

The verified runtime uses an incremental strangler instead of a broad `UPayments.php` rewrite:

- `src/Payment/ProviderResult.php`
- `src/Payment/StatusRateGate.php`
- `src/Payment/OrderLock.php`
- `src/Payment/StatusVerifier.php`
- `src/Payment/PaymentLifecycle.php`

`src/Release/Identity.php` conditionally loads/registers the lifecycle only when the WordPress hook API exists, preserving the Phase 0 isolated identity harness.

Protected H12 token/subscription identifiers remain untouched.

## Review findings closed before merge

Automated review raised four valid findings, all corrected before final merge:

1. **P1 — rate-gate test/runtime seam:** removed the incorrect global-string `function_exists('wp_salt')` pre-check while retaining fail-closed salt handling.
2. **P1 — first-query transient failure:** added explicitly unverified, attempt-scoped retry cursor semantics so a first callback 5xx/network/rate-limit failure can reconcile safely.
3. **P1 — stale lock race:** replaced blind stale-lock deletion with exact database compare-and-swap takeover/release semantics.
4. **P2 — amount rounding mismatch:** replaced Woo display-precision rounding with exact canonical decimal comparison and added a focused permanent harness.

All four PR review threads were resolved only after the fixes were present and tested.

## Non-claims

This closure does not mean the plugin is broadly production-certified. The bounded Security Threat-Model Closure is now independently **DONE / VERIFIED**; architecture quality, full integration/static/browser platforms, WordPress/WooCommerce/PHP/HPOS/Blocks/WPML certification, feature certification, performance/UX/operations and release engineering remain later gates.

The current permitted program gate is **Full Automated Quality Platform — Q10**.
